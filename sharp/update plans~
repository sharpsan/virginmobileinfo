in version 1 updates:
- dark theme option
- more widgets: lockscreen, med, and of course small
- download progress based on guesstimation in extra_table
- "last refreshed" expressed in hours/minutes/seconds since, as opposed to date/time displayed
- "supported" version, with a few extra, non-essential features

version 2 ideas:
- faster updates (cookies to maintain login?)
	- show data usage!
- design-oriented display; prettier

- implement dark/light skin, and add to options (NEXT UPDATE)
- bug: fix back button so that it closes app (DONE)
- add widget preview image (DONE)

- BUG: application DNR's when database is trying to close an already-closed db.  Occurs normally when update is happening, app is closed, service is still happening in the background, or when app is refreshed, app is closed and reopened, then refresh is clicked again. (FUTURE UPDATE)
